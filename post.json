In case you really want to own it just roll out one of the many blogging suites on your server. But **none** can boast of the pain and joy creating your own software\n        brings with it. The creativity, the decision making, the struggles to implement the vision at the micro and macro level,\n        and other nitty gritties spice up the adventure."
